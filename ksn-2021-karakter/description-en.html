<!-- Title: Self Character -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  Pak Dengklek has an independent word $S$ which consists of $N$ characters.
  A word is said to be independent if all its characters are independent.
  A character in a word is said to be independent if fulfils two conditions below:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>different from the previous character or is the first character in that word,</li>
  <li>different from the next character or is the last character in that word.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  For an instance, <code>ABAC</code> is an independent word but <code>AABC</code> is not,
  because the first and the second character in <code>AABC</code> are not independent characters.
</p>
<p>
  Apparently, Pak Dengklek is not satisfied with the word $S$.
  Pak Dengklek wants to make a word $T$ by scrambling the characters in $S$.
  Of course, $T$ must be an independent word.
</p>
<p>
  Pak Dengklek prefers a lexicographically smaller word.
  Therefore, Pak Dengklek asks for your help to obtain the lexicographically smallest $T$.
  It is possible that there is no possible $T$ which is lexicographically smaller than $S$,
  for this case, you do not need to scramble the characters in $S$ so that $T = S$.
</p>

  What is lexicography?
  <div class="spoiler-content">
    A word $S$ is said to be lexicographically smaller than word $T$ if $S$ appeared before $T$ in the dictionary.
    Formally, a word $S$ that consists of $N$ characters is said to be lexicographically smaller than
    word $T$ that also consists of $N$ characters if there is $i$ ($1 \le i \le N$)
    so that $S_1 = T_1$, $S_2 = T_2$, $\ldots$, $S_{i-1} = T_{i-1}$, and $S_i &lt; T_i$.

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
  <li>$1 \le N \le 100\;000$</li>
  <li>$S$ only consists of uppercase letters.</li>
  <li>It is guaranteed that $S$ is an independent word.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Subtasks</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;(8 points) Contains only the following test case:<br/>
    $N = 7$ and the independent word $S$ is <code>ACBACAB</code>.
  </li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6 points) There is no possible $T$ which is lexicographically smaller than $S$.</li>
  <li>(11 points) $S$ only consists of characters <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.</li>
  <li>(10 points) There is no character that appeared more than once in $S$.</li>
  <li>(14 points) $N \le 10$</li>
  <li>(13 points) $N \le 200$</li>
  <li>(15 points) $N \le 3000$</li>
  <li>(23 points) No additional constraints.</li>
</ol>
