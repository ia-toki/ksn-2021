<!-- Title: Balls Delivery -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  At Barisan Hills, there exist $N$ hills numbered from $1$ to $N$ from west to east.
  The $i$-th hill has a height of $H_i$.
</p><p>
  Pak Dengklek has a jetpack that allows him to fly in the air.	
  Pak Dengklek can do the following <strong>simultaneously</strong> with his jetpack.
</p><ul>
  <li>
    Traversing between hills, which does one of the three moves as follows.
    <ul>
      <li>Moves to the east hill next to the current hill. In other words, Pak Dengklek moves to hill $(i + 1)$ if he is currently on hill $i$.</li>
      <li>Moves to the west hill next to the current hill. In other words, Pak Dengklek moves to hill $(i - 1)$ if he is currently on hill $i$.</li>
      <li>Does not move from the current hill.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Change elevation, which does one of the three moves as follows.
    <ul>
      <li>Increases the elevation by one. This move requires fuel of $4$ units.</li>
      <li>Decreases the elevation by one. This move requires fuel of $1$ unit.</li>
      <li>Maintain the current elevation. This move requires fuel of $2$ units.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><p>
  Naturally, when Pak Dengklek is on hill $i$, then his elevation has to be at least $H_i$.
</p><p>
  Pak Dengklek got a request to send $Q$ balls with his jetpack.
  On the $j$-th delivery, Pak Dengklek will start from the top of hill $S_j$ and deliver a ball to the top of hill $T_j$.
  For each delivery, Pak Dengklek wants to minimize the fuel to be used.
  Help Pak Dengklek to calculate the minimum fuel required for each delivery!

<h3>Explanation of Sample 1</h3>

<p>
  To deliver the first ball, Pak Dengklek will start his journey from the top of hill $1$ with the elevation of $9$.
  Pak Dengklek will do the following moves:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Move to the east and decrease the elevation by one.
    This move requires fuel of $1$ and Pak Dengklek moves to hill $2$ with the elevation of $8$.
  </li>
  <li>
    Moves to the east and maintains the elevation.
    This move requires fuel of $2$ and Pak Dengklek moves to hill $3$ with the elevation of $8$.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Pak Dengklek arrives on top of hill $3$ with the total fuel of $1 + 2 = 3$.
  There is no other solution that uses less amount of fuel.
</p>

<p>
  To deliver the second ball, Pak Dengklek will start his journey from the top of hill $4$ with the elevation of $2$.
  Pak Dengklek will do the following moves:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Increases elevation by one, $5$ times, without traversing any other hills.
    This move requires fuel of $5 \times 4 = 20$ and Pak Dengklek stays at hill $4$ with the elevation of $7$.
  </li>
  <li>
    Moves to the west and increases the elevation by one.
    This move requires fuel of $4$ and Pak Dengklek moves to hill $3$ with the elevation of $8$.
  </li>
  <li>
    Moves to the west and decreases the elevation by one.
    This move requires fuel of $1$ and Pak Dengklek moves to hill $2$ with the elevation of $7$.
  </li>
  <li>
    Decreases elevation by one, $6$ times, without traversing any other hills.
    This move requires fuel of $6 \times 1 = 6$ and Pak Dengklek stays at hill $2$ with the elevation of $1$.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Pak Dengklek arrives on top of hill $2$ with the total fuel of $20 + 4 + 1 + 6 = 31$.
  There is no other solution that uses less amount of fuel.
