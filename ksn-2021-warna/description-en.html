<!-- Title: Ball Colouring -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  There are $N$ balls numbered from $1$ to $N$.
  These balls look identical but may be made from different materials.
  For easier identification, Pak Dengklek will colour these balls such that balls with different materials have different colours, and balls with the same material have the same colour.
</p><p>
  To differentiate between one ball and the others, Pak Dengklek uses a device named Ballanyzer.
  However, this device can only be used at most $Q$ times.
  In one usage, Pak Dengklek chooses two integers $L$ and $R$ ($1 \le L \le R \le N$), then the device will tell the number of different materials of balls $L$, $L + 1$, $\ldots$, $R$.
</p><p>
  After using the device, Pak Dengklek will colour each ball with one of the available $N$ colours, which are one of colour $1$, colour $2$, $\ldots$, colour $N$.
  Pak Dengklek asks for your help to use the device then colour the balls.
  If there are more than one possible colouring, you may colour them using any colouring.

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
  <li>$2 \le N \le 1000$</li>
</ul>

<h3>Subtasks</h3>

<ol>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8 points) $Q = 10\;000$, balls with the same material have consecutive numbers.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7 points) $Q = 2000$, balls with the same material have consecutive numbers.</li>
  <li>(19 points) $Q = 2000$, there are at most $3$ different materials.</li>
  <li>(14 points) $Q = 2000$, there are at most $4$ different materials.</li>
  <li>(12 points) $Q = 2000$, there are at least $N - 1$ different materials.</li>
  <li>(21 points) $Q = 10\;000$, $N \le 100$</li>
  <li>(19 points) $Q = 10\;000$</li>
</ol>

<h3>Problem Type Information</h3>

<p>
  This is an "interactive" problem.
  In this problem, you will interact with the judge's program through standard input (stdin) and standard output (stdout).
  See the following interaction carefully.
</p>

<h3>Interaction</h3>

<p>
  In the beginning, you will be given an integer $T$ representing the subtask number, then you will be given $N$ and $Q$ with the following format:
</p><pre>
T
N Q
</pre>

<p>Then, for not more than $Q$ times, you can output to the standard output with the following format:</p>

<pre>
? L R
</pre>

<p>
  This means you give the values $L$ and $R$ to the device.
  The values of $L$ and $R$ must satisfy $1 \le L \le R \le N$.
  For each of the outputs, the number of different materials (denoted by $X$) will be given by the device from input with the following format:
</p>

<pre>
X
</pre>

<p>
  In the end, you have to answer by output with the following format:
</p>

<pre>
! A<sub>1</sub> A<sub>2</sub> â€¦ A<sub>N</sub>
</pre>

<p>
  This means you colour ball $1$, ball $2$, $\ldots$, ball $N$ with colours $A_1$, $A_2$, $\ldots$, $A_N$ respectively.
</p>

<p>
  If you can colour the balls correctly without using the device more than $Q$ times, then you will receive Accepted.
  If you give the wrong colouring, use the device more than $Q$ times, or output with the wrong format, then you will receive Wrong Answer.
</p>

<h3>Sample Interaction</h3>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Input</th>
    <th>Output</th>
    <th>Explanation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><pre>1
5 10000</pre></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>This means you will be tested for the first subtask by colouring $5$ balls and can use the device for at most $10\;000$ times.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td><pre>? 1 5</pre></td>
    <td>You ask the number of different materials of all balls.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><pre>2</pre></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>The device replies that there are $2$ different materials of all balls.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td><pre>? 1 3</pre></td>
    <td>You ask the number of different materials of ball $1$, ball $2$, and ball $3$.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><pre>1</pre></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>The device replies that all materials of ball $1$, ball $2$, and ball $3$ are the same.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td><pre>? 2 4</pre></td>
    <td>You asked the number of different materials of ball $2$, ball $3$, and ball $4$.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><pre>2</pre></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>The device replies that there are two different materials of ball $2$, ball $3$, and ball $4$.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td><pre>! 1 1 1 2 2</pre></td>
    <td>You colour ball $1$ to ball $5$ using colours $1$, $1$, $1$, $2$, and $2$ respectively.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(end)</td>
    <td>(end)</td>
    <td>The interaction ends, the answer is correct, and you get Accepted for this test case.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The colouring $2$, $2$, $2$, $1$, and $1$ would also give consistent replies from the device, so this colouring would also get Accepted.

<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>
  Always flush every time your program gives an output.

<ul>
  <li>For library <code>stdio.h</code> (<code>cstdio</code>):<pre>
fflush(stdout);</pre></li>
  <li>For library <code>iostream</code>:<pre>
std::cout << std::flush;</pre></li>
</ul>
