<!-- Title: Binary Land -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  The country of Toki is an archipelagic state consisting of $N$ islands, numbered from $1$ to $N$.
  There exists a valuable treasure in each island in the country of Toki.
  Island $i$ has a beauty value of $A_i$ and a treasure of value $B_i$.
</p><p>
  Pak Dengklek, an adventurer, wants to collect the treasures.
  Due to strict sea transport regulations, Pak Dengklek can not necessarily travel from any island to any other island.
  Pak Dengklek can travel from the $i$-th island to the $j$-th island, if <em>bitwise XOR</em> of $A_i$ and $A_j$ is greater than both $A_i$ and $A_j$;
  or more formally, $A_i \text{ XOR } A_j > \max(A_i, A_j)$.
  If the condition is not satisfied, then Pak Dengklek cannot travel from the $i$-th island to the $j$-th island.
</p><p>
  Pak Dengklek will take the treasure on the island that he visits.
  Pak Dengklek can travel from island to island as many times as he wants, as long as he satisfies the traveling condition above.
  An island can be visited more than once, but the treasure can only be taken once.
</p><p>
  Pak Dengklek is currently in an airplane, and will be parachuted to one of the $N$ islands.
  Pak Dengklek has not decided on where he will be parachuted, and wonders of the treasures that he will take if he is parachuted on an island.
  Therefore, Pak Dengklek asks you to determine the maximum total value of treasures that he can take if he starts collecting treasures from island $i$, for every $i$ from $1$ to $N$.

<div class="spoiler">
  What is bitwise XOR?
  <div class="spoiler-content">
    <em>Bitwise XOR</em> of two integers $x$ and $y$ can be computed as follows.
    <ol>
      <li>Write $x$ and $y$ in base two with the same bit length.</li>
      <li>Perform the $\text{XOR}$ operation for each corresponding bit pair:
        <ul>
          <li>$0 \text{ AND } 0 = 0$</li>
          <li>$0 \text{ AND } 1 = 1$</li>
          <li>$1 \text{ AND } 0 = 1$</li>
          <li>$1 \text{ AND } 1 = 0$</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Convert the $\text{XOR}$ result back to base ten.</li>
    </ol>
    As an example, $6 \text{ XOR } 10 = 12$.
    Because $6 = 0110$ and $10 = 1010$ in base two, the bitwise XOR obtained is $1100 = 12$ in base ten.

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
  <li>$1 \le N \le 100\;000$</li>
  <li>$1 \le A_i \le 2^{30} - 1$</li>
  <li>$1 \le B_i \le 10^9$</li>
</ul>

<h3>Subtasks</h3>

<ol>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8 points) Contains only the following test case:<br/>
    $N = 8$, $A = [6, 39, 11, 63, 3, 39, 1, 43]$, $B = [4, 8, 3, 7, 9, 1, 2, 2]$.</li>
  <li>(13 points) $N \le 200$</li>
  <li>(10 points) $N \le 2000$</li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4 points) $A_1 = A_2 = \ldots = A_N$</li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;(7 points) There exists integer $k_i$ such that $A_i = 2^{k_i}$.</li>
  <li>(19 points) $A_i \le 2^{12} - 1$</li>
  <li>(39 points) No additional constraints.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>
  The input is given with the following format:
</p>

<pre>
N
A<sub>1</sub> A<sub>2</sub> … A<sub>N</sub>
B<sub>1</sub> B<sub>2</sub> … B<sub>N</sub>
</pre>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
  Output $N$ lines.
  The $i$-th line contains the maximum of the total value of treasures that he can take if he starts collecting treasures from the $i$-th island.
</p>

<h3>Sample Input 1</h3>

<pre>

2 1 1
20 30 10
</pre>

<h3>Sample Output 1</h3>

<pre>

</pre>

<h3>Explanation of Sample 1</h3>

<p>
  The followings are all possible travels.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Travel from island $1$ island to island $2$ (and vice versa) since $2 \text{ XOR } 1 = 3$ and $3 > \max(1, 2)$.</li>
  <li>Travel from the $1$<sup>st</sup> island to the $3$<sup>rd</sup> island (vice versa) since $2 \text{ XOR } 1 = 3$ and $3 > \max(1, 2)$.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Therefore, if Pak Dengklek starts from:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the $1$<sup>st</sup> island: he can travel of island $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 3$ and take treasures from all $3$ islands with total value of $20 + 30 + 10 = 60$; </li>
  <li>the $2$<sup>nd</sup> island: he can travel of island $2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 3$ and take all treasures; </li>
  <li>the $3$<sup>rd</sup> island: he can travel of island $3 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2$ and take all treasures. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Sample Input 2</h3>

<h3>Sample Output 2</h3>

<h3>Explanation of Sample 2</h3>

<p>
  In this sample, Pak Dengklek cannot travel from any islands to any other islands, so that Pak Dengklek can only take the treasure from the island where he starts.
